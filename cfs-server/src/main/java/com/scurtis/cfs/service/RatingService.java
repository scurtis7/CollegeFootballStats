     * FPI is a predictive rating system designed to measure team strength and project performance going forward.
     * The ultimate goal of FPI is not to rank teams 1 through 128; rather, it is to correctly predict games and season outcomes.
     * If Vegas ever published the power rankings it uses to set its lines, they would likely look quite a lot like FPI.
     * FPI is not a prediction but a probability.
